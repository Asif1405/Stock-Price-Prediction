The Root Mean Squared Error for the voted classifier was 527.24. Which was too high. The output graph also reflect the result.
The Root Mean Squared Error for the LSTM was 28.015. Which was way too better. The output graph also reflect the result.
The LSTM model out performed the voted classifier which contains KNN, Support Vector Machine and Random Forrest.
